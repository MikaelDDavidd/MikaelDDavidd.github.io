Here it is where everything starts.

At first I started it all as an entusiast and so I decided to get more into it so here I am.

# Status Saver

This was my first step into the codding universe... and app that you can use to download midia from 
the daily post that people do on WhatsApp Appp.

# AI Project

Now I pretend to start working in a new project... as you will be able to guess now, I like marvel and Iron-man is my favorite though. As you know he is never alone and I am not talking about his wife or his bodyguard... I'm talking about Jarvis,Friday or eve Karen for spider man. I think this is time for me to create a partner too... a tool that will be able to help me in my furter crations. It name's Guideon.
